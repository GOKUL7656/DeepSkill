Instance created using Logger
Both log1 , log2 and log3 are the same instance of Logger class

//Concepts
Singleton - It indicates that the class is constrained to instantiate only one instance in the main class.

The code is implemented by creating a java project and two class-Logger and class-Logger.
class-Logger --> It forms the singleton class to form only one instance of the class Logger.
class-Test --> It is a test class to show the instance created is same for every objects created in the Java Project.
